          Ramses II, also known as Ramses the Great, is widely considered to be the most powerful pharaoh of ancient Egypt. During his reign from 1279 to 1213 B.C., he conducted military campaigns in Nubia, Syria, and Canaan, defeated the enigmatic Sea People in a naval battle in the Nile Delta, and claimed victory over Egypt's Hittite rivals in the Battle of Kadesh (a conflict that ended with the signing of the world's first treaty).

Ramses also built on a colossal scale, most notably the massive Ramesseum tomb complex in Thebes and the Great Temple at Abu Simbel, where 65-foot high depictions of the pharaoh seated on his throne flanking the entrance.

The colossus that arrived at the Grand Egyptian Museum has had a circuitous history, beginning with its transport from the quarries of Aswan to the Temple of Ptah in the ancient capital of Memphis in the 13th century B.C. Lost to the sands over millennia, the statue was rediscovered by Italian Egyptologist Giovanni Battista Caviglia (the archaeologist who originally excavated the Sphinx) in 1820. Caviglia offered his discovery, lying on its side and broken into six pieces, to an Italian duke who turned down his gift due to the cost and practicalities of moving the enormous sculpture. The British Museum later waved away a similar offer of the statue by an Egyptian pasha for similar reasons.
